It is the second most important aspect of personal expression, topped only by personality itself. For an industry that is so vast, it is typical that there would be environmental concerns about how garments are made. Research has shown that much of the fast fashion flying around today contains synthetic microfibers and harsh dyes. Accumulation of these textiles in landfills leads to toxicity in the environment. The obvious solution is going sustainable. Organic cotton and linen are cultivated without harmful pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. If you have not switched yet, here are three reasons why you should start.",

Since this specific type of clothing wasn't mass-produced using modern shortcuts, you get a great looking, pure and unique item. There are so many eras to choose from: 70s, 80s, 90s etc. and now is a great time to be a vintage lover. A vintage jacket is the best way to start your outfit. Most people can't function if they don't have their signature look. Vintage is becoming very popular which is a good and bad thing. The demand for this specific type of style is on the rise. The market is now saturated with claims of selling \"vintage style\". On the other hand if the proper steps are taken to ensure the items are really vintage, history will continue to be preserved which means the environment will benefit as well. If you've never worn true vintage you are really missing out because it is unique, with a great history, your wardrobe will thank you.",
